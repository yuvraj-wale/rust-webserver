# Rust Web Server

This project is a simple, multi-threaded web server built with Rust. It's designed to deliver a basic web page to any client that requests it. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If Rust is not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd rust-webserver
   ```

3. **Run the server:**

   Compile and run the web server using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool:

   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

   This command compiles the project and starts the server.

### Accessing the Web Server

After starting the server, you can access the default web page by visiting:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Open this URL in your web browser, and you should be served the default page provided by the web server.
